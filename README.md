# Twitter Fetch App
This is just a simple ReactJS-based app to fetch tweets by username or a keyword. It was created by Jorge SÃ¡nchez Blanco as a technical challenge. It divides its rendering components from its operative logic, which is managed using Redux.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
